        <div id="flex1"> Marlene Dumas started working on these special paintings after seeing the opression and sexism woman had to deal with, she always painted the peron purely from pictures, since some weren't even around anymore. This snake in particular interested me since the rest are all humans. When I dove in I learned the truth, the snake was there for Eve, from Adam and Eve. Eve is in her eyes one of the most important people since if it wasn't for her we wouldn't be here.</div>
